## Space measure

The limitations of computers also rely on the amount of data that they can hold. That's why another of the important measures that one has to consider when designing an algorithm is the **space** that the computer has.

Optimizing this usage, although not as important as speed, is also necessary for ensuring that a program will run as intended in most modern machines.

## Maintainability

In the real world, one of the most important things is to design reusable and maintainable code. That's why another of the measures could be the way the algorithm itself works, and if it is easy enough to perform any changes that might be presented in the future (for example, if a company decides to add a new category of products, and our algorithm searches the most popular products for each category).

To understand a problem, one must write it in a way that transmits the main idea.
Also, a statement can be proved mathematically if we do a careful process that demonstrates that such affirmation is correct, or we find a case in which is not.
> Mathematics is rigorous and precise. Language is ambiguous.

## Statements in mathematics
Can be of four types, depending on the object that one is using:

- Object *a* has property *P*.
- Every object of type *T* has property *P*.
- There is *some* object of type *T* that has a property *P*.
- If statement *A*, then statement *B*.

### Keywords
All of these statements fall into one of these keywords:
- And
- Or
- Not
- Implies
- For all
- There exists (for particular cases).

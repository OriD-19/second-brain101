The most common data structure, it holds a series of values in a contiguous memory address.

This means that an array is a very well suited data structure that represents sets of data, like some series of numbers or names.

It is one of the most basic and common, so it is fundamental to know how it works.

### Strengths

- Very easy to use.
- Exists in all modern programming languages.
- Constant time for accessing individual elements (through a number called index).

### Limitations

- Linear insertion and erasing of elements.
- Complexity can increase as we nest other arrays.
- Fixed size.

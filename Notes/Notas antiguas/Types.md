Haskell is statically typed, which means that every type is known at compile time. It also means that if a program has an error, the compiler is going to notify it before even compiling.

The notation for declaring types is:

```
functionName :: Type1 -> Type2... -> TypeN
```

Which is read as "*functionName* is a function that maps from a *Type1* to a *Type2* to a *Type3*... Until we reach the last arrow, which is the return value for **the whole function** (*TypeN*)".

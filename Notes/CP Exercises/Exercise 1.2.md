## Input

The input of the problem is a number $x$ such that $(1 \leq x \leq 100)$.

## Output

For a value $y$ that represents the number that we're looking for, the output of the program should be of three types:

- The value $x$ of the input is greater than $y$.
- The value $x$ is less than $y$
- The value $x$ is equal to $y$.

The only way of terminating the program is by falling into the last case, so the other two cases should act as hints for the user.

## Interactive

Because the problem gives you information (feedback) based on your real-time input (?).

Also, we could consider the fact that the input is constantly changing, as we need to guess a different number each time.

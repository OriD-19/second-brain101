1) 
   - The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The output consists of a single integer `c` such that $max(a, b) \mod min(a, b) = c$

2) 
   - The input consists of an integer $D$, which represents the degree of a polynomial (depending if the problem is asking for a square polynomial, then we could omit this value). Then, $D + 1$ values follow, representing the coefficient of each term in descending order (for example, $a, b, c$ for a polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$). If any of the terms does not exist, then the value of the coefficient will be equal to zero.
   - The output of the program should be a single value $X$, such that the original polynomial equal to zero holds true for the value of $X$.

3) 
   - The input of the problem consists of two numbers $a$ and $b$.
   - The output of the problem consists of a number $c$ such that $a \times b = c$

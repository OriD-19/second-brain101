Mathematics is not only calculating -> Formulating and understanding abstract concepts.
Its symbols can be written, but mathematics are only alive when someone interprets them and transforms them in valuable data.

Modern mathematics, around nineteenth century, changed the way in which we thought about solving problems. We went from using a series of techniques (resembling a "cookbook"), to understanding and formulating new abstract concepts and relationships.

Today's math is all about understanding, not solving per se.

## The shift in paradigm
Computational (calculating) -> Conceptual (understanding)
> INNOVATIVE MATHEMATICAL THINKERS.

**Design thinking** for mathematics?

> LEARNING HOW TO LEARN.

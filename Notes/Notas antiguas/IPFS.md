# What is the InterPlanetary File System

It is a protocol, that **distributes the data** into many nodes through a peer-to-peer network (i.e, sharing and storing data in a *distributed file system*).

In summary, the protocol separates the files in pieces, and each one of them is assigned a **content identifier**, which is then used to **retrieve** the data from the distributed network.

It is specially useful when working with different **decentralized technologies**, such as [[Web3]]
